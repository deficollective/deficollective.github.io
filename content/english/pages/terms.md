## Introduction

These terms and conditions ("**Terms**") apply to your ("**You**" or "**User**") access and use of the website [https://deficollective.org](https://deficollective.org/), and any associated content or feature, including the Collective's social media channels ("**Website**"), offered by the Swiss non-profit association DeFi Collective, Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland ("**Collective**" or "**We**").

Please read these Terms carefully when accessing or using the Website. Each time You do access or use the Website, You irrevocably agree to be bound by the most current version of these Terms, as indicated above. If You do not agree to these Terms, as amended from time to time, You may not access or use the Website.


## Scope

### Informational content only

The Website does not contain any service offering, such as an agency, consultancy, advisory, purchase or similar offering. Rather, You understand and acknowledge that this Website is strictly for informational purposes only, and this Website is not tailored to the specific needs of any individual, entity, organization or other group. In particular, nothing contained on the Website (for the avoidance of doubt, also nothing contained or shares on the Collective's social media channels) should be understood as:



* Any kind of financial/investment or other tax, legal, cyber security, etc., advice.
* Any kind of financial endorsement of any particular project, token, token holding strategy, etc. The Collective makes no forward looking statements with regard to the future or expected value of any project or token.
* Any kind of recommendation or offer to participate in any project or purchase any token.
* Any intention to create any fiduciary relationship or duties between the Collective and You or any third party. 

You furthermore understand and acknowledge that DeFi technology in particular, and smart contracts, blockchains, cryptographic tokens, and related systems and software in general, are nascent, highly experimental, risky, and subject to constant change. The Collective aims to further the public understanding of these technologies, but is not here to give You advice. You are solely responsible for any of Your use of such technologies, and we strongly recommend anyone to thoroughly understand the risk associated with the use of these technologies before engaging with them. Do your own research.

### Supporting the Collective

The Website outlines a number of possibilities how You can support the Collective, including through donations and other ways of contributions.

* **Donations**: Any donations made by You to the account [grantsfortheants.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDc6f869d2D34E4aee3E89A51f2Af6D54F0F7f690) (0xDc6f869d2D34E4aee3E89A51f2Af6D54F0F7f690), on any of the supported chains: Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon-POS and Polygon-zkEVM, are subject to our [Donation Terms](../donation-terms). The Collective and You may enter into a separate agreement governing your donation and/or other support, in which case (unless specifically agreed otherwise) such separate agreement prevails.

* **Contributions**: There are numerous ways in which You can directly support and participate in the Collective beyond donations as laid out above. The further details of Your contributions, including the scope and mode of collaboration, potential remuneration, etc., may be defined in a separate agreement between You and the Collective.

## Collective social media channels

The Collective maintains a number of social media channels, including Discord, Twitter (X), LinkedIn, and Youtube.

By accessing and participating in these channels, both You and the Collective agree to treat each other and other users in an ethical, fair and open manner. This includes crediting others for their work, acknowledging each other's contributions, not stealing, cheating, rugging or similar, not doxxing, disclosing any actual or potential economic and other conflicts of interest, being transparent, being open to the views and ideas of others, and, in general, being respectful, mindful and acting in line with the Collective's mission and vision (as further outlined on the Website). 

The Collective's social media channels are a place dedicated to share ideas and initiatives that help advance the decentralization of financial infrastructure. Do not share any content or ideas that You do not wish to be heard, acknowledged, further shared, acted and improved upon. Do not share any content that is illegal or infringing and only share content that You have the legal right to share (this includes compliance with any intellectual property laws).

You understand and agree that the Collective may, at any time and in its sole discretion, restrict Your access to the Collective's social media channels if You do not comply with the above. Additional terms and conditions of the respective social media channel may apply.
