January was another challenging month for the Collective, closing its book yet again with a sizeable shortfall, this time of - $23 256.04, with a sizable drop of revenues of - 22.2%. 

While those figures can seem alarming at face value, they have to be confronted to the increased expenses incurred since April, following investments into growing DeFiScan. The Collective is built to sustain, and still commands enough stable reserves to keep operating in these tough markets. Still, we've been collecting challenging months like Pokémons lately, and the situation cannot sustain as such. **Several measures are already implemented and will be discussed in the next report covering February**. 

Expenses and other revenues remained steady, and there were no major strategic adjustments to treasury composition. The focus remained firmly on sustainability and supporting our ecosystem partners.

For a full breakdown of revenue streams, accounting methodology, and Collective activities, please refer to the [Reporting Policy](https://deficollective.org/reporting-policy/).


## Treasury Report

The treasury closed January at **$1,176,529 (-14.9*% MoM**, down from $1,382,487 in December). The bulk of the drop can be attributed mainly to AERO, VELO and LQTY, three assets which witnessed adverse price action this month, and which constitutes core holdings for the Collective's treasury.

By month’s end, the treasury allocation stood at **30%** locked assets, **0%** in L2 liquid positions, **47%** in L1 liquid positions, **23%** in Perma LPs, and the rest held in liquid operational balances. The treasury remains well-structured and stable, with capital consistently deployed across productive assets.

## Earnings Report

Revenues totaled **$13,929.98 (-22% MoM)**, resulting in a shortfall of -$23,256.04. Adverse market conditions and decreasing DEX volumes contributed to this underperformance, however, the Collective holds enough stablecoin balance to weather yet another storm.

L2 revenues came in at **$5,080.72**, roughly stables compared to December ($5439.33).


Donations totaled **7086.26**, stemming entirely from the [DeFi Collective Liquity's Protocol Incentivized Liquidity Initiative](https://voting.liquity.org/t/the-defi-collective-bold-liquidity-initiative-maximize-bold-footprint-on-l2s/15/42), supporting BOLD's liquidity on L2s. No harvest was performed on mainnet, and the permaLP positions returned $2,278.47 this month.
