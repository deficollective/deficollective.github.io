## The Collective's participation

The DeFi Collective is happy to be one of the community partners of the CV Summit 2025 alongside many other non-profits and research institutes in the local crypto community.

The DeFi Collective will be here to discuss everything related to decentralized finance, as well as the importance of promoting decentralization in this industry, with tools like @defiscan_info available to assist in this regard.

More and more institutions care about integrating DeFi into their products and offerings. Regulatory and legal clarity for DeFi is coming, giants like S&P Global are starting to give credit ratings to DeFi protocols ([S&P Global gave Sky a B- rating](https://www.theblock.co/post/366106/sp-global-sky-protocol)), citing centralization and liquidity risks!) and the merger of finance and blockchain is accelerating at a rapid pace. We’re here to remind you that while this is exciting, decentralization remains a core building block and key ingredient of the financial systems of the future.
