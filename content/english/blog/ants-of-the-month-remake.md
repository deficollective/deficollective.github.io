From the Collective’s perspective, involving the community is necessary, and all spontaneous contributions are welcome. Whether you’re a developer, researcher, marketer, policy expert, or someone sharing the Collective’s vision for decentralized finance, your insights and skills can make a significant difference.

We already rewarded members outside of contributors for their activities with the “Ant of the Month”, a special status with a 10,000 USDC delegation on PoolTogether. 

This delegated amount stays in a wallet controlled by PoolTogether, but the benefactor will earn all the winning odds. It’s like the delegation owner was playing with 10,000 USDC, and this delegation is given every month to the Collective’s most committed community members!

Thanks to PoolTogether, our Ants of the Month program has been enhanced. **We now have a delegation of 75,000 POOL** tokens to recognize and reward outstanding contributions from the DeFi Collective community, outside of contributors!

## The Ant of the Month titles

This delegation of 75,000 POOL will be split into three, as it will be possible to get three different titles associated with different skills.

**The Development Title:** Participate in the development of a protocol supported by the Collective like commits, pull requests, signalling issues or reviewing code on a repo. We can monitor the people involved in development directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/liquity/bold/graphs/contributors).

**The Data analysis title:** Create dashboards on Dune showing data about supported protocols ([example](https://dune.com/alice_rozengarden/liquity-v2-vote)) or identifying suspicious activity like washtrading ([Kaskade](https://deficollective.org/blog/kaskade-campaign-report/) campaign report)

**The Awareness title:  Everything about bringing visibility to the Collective, DeFiScan, or any supported protocol as a whole
* Visibility for the collective or DeFiScan (participation on social media, content creation)
* Ping DeFi protocols that pretend to be decentralized or spot genuinely decentralized protocols so they can get in touch with the Collective 
* Improvement proposals for the Collective or DeFiScan

**A same member can participate in several Ant of the Month titles at the same time**, as long as he follows the rules to join for the titles.

## How to participate?

Everything happens in the DeFi Collective’s Discord Server, and anyone can participate in becoming an Ant of the Month by doing as following:
![tdc_discord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stengarl/img/refs/heads/main/TDC_aotm.png)
**Step 1:** Get into the channel associated with the category you wish to participate in.

**Step 2:** Create a thread in that channel 

**Step 3:** Put your name and associated accounts (Socials, GitHub, Dune...) in the thread 

**Step 4:** Post your contributions in your thread, with the necessary information:
* One sentence descriptor
* Date
* Link
* Other relevant information like screens
**Once you have created your thread and made a relevant contribution for the current month, you will be able to participate in the winner selection!**

## Winner selection and rewards
All members who made at least one relevant contribution for the current month in their respective threads are eligible to be elected “Ant of the Month” in the category in which they participated. 

For example, members with contributions in their thread during May are qualified for the May Ants of the Month title, and members without a thread (or with a thread not having any saved contribution during that month) are not qualified. As soon as the month is over, the nomination is made, and the Ants of the Month are voted on.

The DeFi Collective makes it a point of honor to get the community involved, especially our supporters. Therefore, the First Anniversary Commemorative NFT holders will elect the Ants of the Month!

Winners are selected by voting via Snapshot. The voters will be the [“First Anniversary Commemorative NFT"](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x3ac9274eefc727439b546b5224aa896101813f9f) holders, currently available on the OP Mainnet. Users who hold this NFT get one vote to elect the Ants of the Month. Please note that holders have one vote, no matter how many NFTs they have.

There will be **three votes** for Developer, Data Analysis and Awareness. The voting period lasts **7 days from the beginning of the next month**, so all the votes are open until the 7th of next month at 23:59:59 UTC.

**Finally, the vote can be weighted**. Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices, e.g, 100% for one, 80% / 20% for two, or 50% / 20% / 20% / 10% for four choices, so they can weigh up the contributions or skills they want to reward.

The contributor with the most votes will get the "Ant of the month" title in their associated category and a 25,000 POOL delegation for one month! This delegation will be run in parallel with the already existing 10,000 USDC delegation, so participants will have many more opportunities.
![aotm_rewards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stengarl/img/refs/heads/main/aotm_pool.png)
A 25,000 przPOOL delegation on Ethereum mainnet currently amounts to 1 in 1.29 monthly chances of winning. From a certain point of view, achieving Ant of the Month status allows you to become a whale.

The amount that can be won currently ranges from $28 to $5,062. Thanks to the same position (przPOOL), [the Collective recently won a 4 ETH jackpot](https://x.com/DeFiCollective_/status/1894407070423642560), you could be next!

## Parting Words

All relevant contributions to the Collective are considered for becoming one of the Ants of the Month and receiving the associated rewards. 

Many thanks to PoolTogether  for designing this delegation system and offering such a large amount, enabling community members to get more involved in genuinely decentralized finance

We look forward to your contributions, which may lead to new opportunities in DeFi!
