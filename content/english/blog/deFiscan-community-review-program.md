Are you deep in the trenches, knowing the protocols you use in and out? It’s time to put that knowledge to work, doing a service for the whole industry and getting paid for it!

After the successful release of [DeFiScan](https://www.defiscan.info/) and the “How much De is in my Fi” competition last week during Devcon, we will now shift gears and focus on increasing coverage of the reviewed DeFi protocols. And how better to do this than through an incentivized community program with a total **prize pool of 10,000 LUSD!**

This article outlines the details of the program.

**This program has been replaced by [the DeFiScan Bounty Program](https://deficollective.org/blog/defiscan-bounties/)**.

* The total payout for community submitted protocol reviews is LUSD 10,000

* Only PRs containing a complete and accurate review are merged and earn the prize of 500 LUSD
* Payouts are made in LUSD on Optimism

### Getting Started

The following steps outline the process of registering for and conducting a successful protocol review. Make sure you understand and follow this process:



1. Read the defiscan methodology and existing reviews to familiarize yourself with the expected submission process
2. Clone the permission-scanner repository from our GitHub
3. Fork the defiscan repository from our GitHub
4. Copy the review template and complete the information in the frontmatter with the details of the targeted DeFi protocol
5. Register your participation for the specific protocol by creating a draft PR with the review template on the defiscan repository
6. Complete the review within 2 weeks of registration (through step 5) by updating your PR with the full information
7. Ping the team in the DeFiScan channel on our GitHub
8. Assist the team in finalizing the review if any information is missing or incomplete
9. Once verified the team will merge your PR and coordinate for the payout - thank you!


### Successful Reviews

A review is considered successful if it follows the process outlined above and is ultimately merged to the main repository. In particular, this requires that:



* Registration of a protocol/chain, that is **not yet in review**, by submitting a draft PR
* Completion and submission of final PR with complete and accurate review **within 2 weeks** after registration
* Assisting the DeFi Collective team with final corrections and cleanups and merge or PR **within 1 week** after submission of final PR

The prize of 500 LUSD is only awarded to successful reviews and paid out in LUSD on Optimism.
